# SS7 Machine Learning Analysis

## Introduction

This is a simple Apache Spark application to be used in conjunction
with Apache Kafka and the ELK stack. It is designed to analyze network traffic
generated by the [SS7 Attack
Simulator](https://github.com/polarking/jss7-attack-simulator)
and perform machine learning on said traffic.

This project is part of a master thesis currently being done at NTNU Gj√∏vik,
Norway.
