# SS7 Machine Learning Analysis

## Introduction
This is a simple Apache Spark application to be used in conjunction with Apache
Kafka and the ELK stack. It is designed to analyze network traffic generated by
the [SS7 Attack Simulator](https://github.com/polarking/jss7-attack-simulator)
machine learning.

The application reads preprocessed data from the Kafka topic *ss7-preprocessed*
generated by [SS7 ML
Preprocessing](https://github.com/polarking/ss7-ml-preprocess) and outputs
results to the Elasticsearch index *ss7-ml-results*.

This project is part of a master thesis currently being done at NTNU Gj√∏vik,
Norway.

## Instructions
It is a requirement that both Elasticsearch and Apache Kafka is running on
localhost. The application expects the following command line arguments:

1. URL of the Spark master. In the form spark://host:port.
2. Username for the Elasticsearch cluster.
3. Password for the Elasticsearch cluster.
4. File path to the training data.

The application can be started using spark-submit:

```bash
bin/spark-submit \
  --class Main \
  --master spark://host:port \
  [application jar] \
  [Master URL] \
  [Elasticsearch username] \
  [Elasticsearch password] \
  [Path for training data]
```

## Build
The project uses sbt as its build tool. To compile the project use the assembly plugin:

```bash
sbt assembly
```

This creates a fat jar that resolves all dependencies required by Spark.
